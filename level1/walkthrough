When we check our binary we can see that before the main there is a function called run.
In the main, we have a call to gets, and a static buffer.
The function run uses system to open a shell.
We just need to use a buffer overflow to execute the function run by overriding the EIP.

The buffer size is 60, but the EIP is a but further so that's why we pad with 76 chars.
We also add a cat so we can get a hold of the fd of the shell, otherwise it will close itself.

Exploit:
(python -c 'print "a"*76 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"'; cat) | ./level1
