By understanding the source code, we can note that the binary takes an
argument, perform an atoi on said argument and store at the index returned by
atoi on a buffer a '\0'.
Then there is a strcmp between the buffer and argv[1]. So by passing an empty
string the comparison will hold true and a shell will be open.
