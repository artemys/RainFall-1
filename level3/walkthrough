In this binary we can observe that there is yet another buffer, but the function
fgets is used to fill it. Fgets controls how many characters will be written to
the buffer so we cannot use a buffer overflow here.

However, by checking the assembly, we can observe two things that can point us
towards the exploit. First, the buffer is passed to printf to be displayed.
Second, there is a cmp 0x40 with an address. If the cmp holds true, the program
will branch into a /bin/sh.

We then deduce we merely need to change the value at address 0x804988c to 0x40
to exploit this binary. We can do that by using the %n specifier in printf.
