with this exec, when we passe 1 argv, the function return "Nope"
and segfaut when there is no argv.

In the main function we saw 2 call malloc and a strcpy
then the main make a call to the function who is 
stored in eax.

there is 2 other function, 
m, who call puts and n who make a syscall.
at the actual state, the address in eax is the m function's address.

the goal is to change the address in eax with the n function


to find the argv 
ebp + 8 = argc 
ebp + 12 = argv
*argv = argv[0]
*(argv + 1) = argv[1]


./level6 `python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"'`
