There is only a binary and nothing else, if we run the program it segfaults.
We open the program with gdb to understand how it works.
We can observe there is an atoi call with argv[1], and then a cmpl with atoi return and 0x1a7 (423).
If the comparison holds true, a shell will be open.
We merely need to execute the program with 423 to have a shell as level1 and cat the .pass file.

Exploit:
./level0 423
whoami
cat /home/user/level1/.pass
